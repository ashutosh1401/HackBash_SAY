# TEAM S.A.Y

This is team participating in hackbash.

#### Basic IDEA

We are developing a web application in which users have to input images of their crops and ML model would identify disease if exists and web app would suggest solution to the problems. Further Users could interact with Experts to solve this issue or any other farming issues. This would help farmers in increasing their productivity and further increase in employement opportunities.
This Web app is also a PWA which makes it cross-platform.
